# HTTP API

Base path: `/api/v1`. All requests and responses are JSON. Errors look like:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "invalid_input", "message": "task.priority must be an integer from 1 (highest) to 4 (lowest)" } }
```

## Authentication

Two options:

- **Session cookie** (the web app). Obtained from `auth/register` or `auth/login`. State-changing requests must come from the app's own origin.
- **Bearer token** (scripts, CLI). Create one in **Settings → API tokens** or via `POST /tokens`, then send `Authorization: Bearer ot_…`.

```bash
export OT=https://todo.example.com
export TOKEN=ot_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Endpoints

| GET | `/api/v1/auth/status` | none | `{setupRequired, signupAllowed, authenticated, user, version}` |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/register` | none | `{email, name?, password}` → 201 `{user}` + cookie. First account becomes owner |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/login` | none | `{email, password}` → `{user}` + cookie |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/logout` | cookie | 204 |
| GET | `/api/v1/me` | yes | `{user}` |
| GET | `/api/v1/tokens` | yes | `{tokens:[{id,name,createdAt,lastUsedAt}]}` |
| POST | `/api/v1/tokens` | yes | `{name}` → 201 `{token, secret}` (secret shown once) |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/tokens/{id}` | yes | 204 |
| GET | `/api/v1/tasks` | yes | `{tasks:[…]}`; `?include_deleted=true` to include tombstones |
| POST | `/api/v1/tasks` | yes | create → 201 task |
| GET | `/api/v1/tasks/{id}` | yes | task or 404 |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/tasks/{id}` | yes | partial update → task |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/tasks/{id}` | yes | soft delete → 204 |
| GET/POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE | `/api/v1/projects…` | yes | same shape for projects |
| POST | `/api/v1/sync` | yes | device sync, see `docs/sync.md` |
| GET | `/api/v1/export` | yes | full JSON export, including deleted items |

### Task fields

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | string | |
| `description` | string | |
| `project_id` | string or null | null = Inbox |
| `priority` | 1–4 | 1 highest, 4 default |
| `due` | `{date:"YYYY-MM-DD", time?:"HH:MM"}` or null | floating date |
| `labels` | string[] | |
| `position` | number | sort order inside a list |
| `completed_at`, `deleted_at` | unix ms or null | |
| `created_at` | unix ms | set by the server on create if missing |

### Project fields

`name` (string), `color` (string, CSS colour), `position` (number), `archived` (boolean), `parent_id` (string or null), `created_at`, `deleted_at`.

## Examples

Create a task due tomorrow at 9:00 in a project:

```bash
curl -sS "$OT/api/v1/tasks" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"title":"Call the plumber","priority":2,"project_id":"<project-id>","due":{"date":"2026-10-11","time":"09:00"}}'
```

Complete it:

```bash
curl -sS -X PATCH "$OT/api/v1/tasks/<id>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"completed_at\": $(date +%s000)}"
```

List open tasks in the Inbox with `jq`:

```bash
curl -sS "$OT/api/v1/tasks" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq '.tasks[] | select(.project_id == null and .completed_at == null) | .title'
```

Export everything:

```bash
curl -sS "$OT/api/v1/export" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -o opentodo-export.json
```

## Behaviour notes

- Every write through this API is recorded in the operation log with server time, so connected devices see it on their next sync (within 30 s, or immediately when they next edit or regain focus).
- Writes to unknown fields or with wrong types are rejected as a whole; nothing is partially applied.
- Deletes are tombstones. Use `include_deleted=true` or the export to see them.
- Rate limits apply to `auth/login` and `auth/register` (10 per minute per IP).
