# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Read-only tools
`tools/list` SHALL always advertise `list_projects`, `list_tasks`, `get_task`, `search_tasks`, `today_summary` and `list_time_entries` with argument schemas and a read-only annotation, and SHALL add write tools only as the write permission gate allows. Read tools SHALL filter as before, return structured JSON, exclude deleted entities, cover only the token's user, write nothing, and reflect only data devices have synced. Task results SHALL carry `tracked_minutes` (every member's live entries, a running one to the server time). `list_time_entries` SHALL take `task_id`, `from`, `to`, `running` and `limit`, return the entries the user can read with `task_id`, `user_id`, `started_at`, `ended_at`, `minutes` and `note` (the note marked as untrusted text, "[encrypted]" when it is ciphertext), and offer a cursor for more. No tool SHALL start, stop or edit an entry.

#### Scenario: Today's tasks
- **WHEN** an assistant calls `list_tasks` with `view: "today"` and a `timezone`
- **THEN** the result lists open tasks due today or overdue in that time zone, each with id, title, project name, priority, due, labels and `tracked_minutes`, ordered overdue first

#### Scenario: Search
- **WHEN** an assistant calls `search_tasks` with `query: "dentist"`
- **THEN** the result lists non-deleted tasks whose title or description contains "dentist", with a `next_cursor` when more than `limit` match

#### Scenario: Invalid arguments
- **WHEN** `get_task` is called without `id` or `list_tasks` with `priority: 7`
- **THEN** the response is a JSON-RPC `-32602` error naming the argument

#### Scenario: Unsynced edits are not visible
- **WHEN** a device has created a task offline that has not synced yet
- **THEN** the tools do not return it until the device syncs, and the result carries the server time so the assistant can state how fresh the data is

#### Scenario: Read token sees only read tools
- **WHEN** a client with a `read` token calls `tools/list` while the owner and the user have allowed assistant writes
- **THEN** exactly the six read tools are listed

#### Scenario: Entries of a week
- **WHEN** an assistant calls `list_time_entries` with `from: "2026-10-12"`, `to: "2026-10-18"` and a `timezone`
- **THEN** the result lists the user's readable entries that started in those local days, each with its minutes and the task's title, and the server time

#### Scenario: No write tool for entries
- **WHEN** an `agent` token with every write switch on calls `tools/list`
- **THEN** no tool that starts, stops or edits a time entry is listed, and `tools/call` for such a name is refused like every unknown tool (JSON-RPC `-32602`)
