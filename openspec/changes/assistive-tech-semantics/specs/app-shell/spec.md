## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Page changes are announced

The browser tab title SHALL name the current page ("Today – OpenTodo"), following the page heading also when its text arrives later. A navigation the person started SHALL move focus to the new page's heading, except on the first load (including the start-view redirect), while a dialog, an overlay or the task panel holds focus, while a text field has it, and when the new page moved focus into itself. A "Skip to content" link SHALL be the first focusable element of the shell, shown while focused, and SHALL move focus to the page heading. This is presentation only and behaves the same offline.

#### Scenario: Navigating from the sidebar

- **WHEN** the user activates "Today" in the sidebar
- **THEN** the tab title is "Today – OpenTodo" and focus is on the page heading

#### Scenario: First load

- **WHEN** the app opens at its start view
- **THEN** focus is not moved

#### Scenario: A dialog holds focus

- **WHEN** a navigation happens while focus is in a dialog
- **THEN** focus stays in the dialog

#### Scenario: Skip link

- **WHEN** the user presses Tab on a fresh page and activates the first link
- **THEN** focus moves to the page heading
